"""Timed passive item cooldowns, read off the passive-inventory pass.

Every number in these tests is a live measurement from 2026-08-03 against
`Megabonk.exe`, not an invention: `cooldown = max(5, 45 - 3n)` at 42/36/33/30
for n = 1/3/4/5, an absolute mark on `MyTime.time` re-armed by exactly
`+cooldown` on a trigger and to `my_time + 2.000` on any pickup, and a clock
that freezes bit-exact under pause and on the death screen.

The class-name check is the load-bearing test here. Field offsets are per class,
so binding the wrong class does not raise -- a live sweep for floats that track
the game clock returned nine hits, of which one was this item, seven were
sub-second proc timers (two of them at `0x3C`, exactly where the lantern keeps
`cooldown`), and one was not a declared field at all.
