"""Builder for `TemplateRuntimeFilters`.

Same contract as `compare_runs.py` and `player_stats.py`: call the component's
**real** constructor with explicit fakes. Adding a constructor argument breaks
every call site here loudly.

Added by step 22b, the step that introduced the service -- the migration order
`test_componentization_inventory.py`'s header states.

`attach()` is the one addition the other builders do not need. `active_templates`
and `template_stats` are delegating properties on `MegabonkApp` now, and an
`object.__new__` double has no owner behind them: it silently falls back to its
own `__dict__`, which is the affordance `ScannerMixin.client` established. A
double that also calls `_sync_runtime_filters` needs the real owner, and needs
its pre-set state carried *into* it rather than stranded in the fallback slots.

    The four default ports are copies of the production lambdas, reading the
    same attributes off the double. That is deliberate: a builder whose ports
    are stubs proves the service runs, not that the app hands it the right
    things. `refresh_stats` keeps the app-side "are the stats widgets built"
    guard for the same reason.

    Order matters: the double's `app.active_templates = [...]` lines run before
    this and land in the `__dict__` fallback, so they are read back out and
    handed to the owner. Attaching first and assigning after works too -- this
    way round is supported so the existing doubles keep reading top-to-bottom.
