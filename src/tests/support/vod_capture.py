"""Builder for the VOD capture service.

The same contract as `tests/support/run_lifecycle.py` and
`tests/support/player_stats.py`: call the component's **real** constructor with
explicit fakes, rather than borrowing `MegabonkApp`'s MRO through
`object.__new__`. Adding a dependency to `VodCapture` breaks every call site
here loudly, where `object.__new__` absorbs it silently and surfaces it as an
`AttributeError` at the first read, in whichever test happens to reach it
first.

**Deliberately not used by every recording test.** The `_sync_run_state`
scenarios in `test_gui_run_control.py` keep `build_recording_app`, because what
they exercise is the round trip through the *real* memory-reading code path --
`FakeSeedStateClient` feeding `_read_player_stats_recording_state_safe`, and a
real `LiveRunTracker` keeping the update -> runtime_snapshot round trip honest.
Swapping those for two lambdas would replace a real collaborator with a fiction
and turn an integration test into a restatement of the fake, which §5 of the
roadmap names as how fiction gets into this suite. They reach the service
through `vod_capture(app)` instead. This builder is for the cases that genuinely
have no app in them.

Every argument is a callable because every dependency of `VodCapture` is: a
mixin method read `self` late, a constructor argument reads it once, and step 20
shipped that difference as a bug twice in one commit.
