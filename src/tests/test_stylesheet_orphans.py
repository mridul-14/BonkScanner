"""No widget may be styled only by the fallback stylesheet.

``build_qt_app_stylesheet`` picks its base with

    base_stylesheet = redesign_stylesheet or legacy_stylesheet

so ``legacy_stylesheet`` is what ships *instead of* the redesign asset when that
file cannot be read -- not alongside it. Any rule that exists only in the legacy
block therefore applies in no real build. Nine did: the amber warning card and
its title, the Support heading, note and divider, and the four brand-coloured
support buttons. They looked plain grey for as long as the redesign asset has
been shipping, and nothing failed, because a missing QSS rule is not an error --
the widget just renders with whatever it inherits.

This is a ratchet on that, and it only knows one thing: an ``objectName`` that
the legacy block names must also be named by the sheet that actually ships.
Names styled by property selectors, by inline stylesheets or not at all are none
of its business -- it never asks whether a rule *should* exist, only whether one
that does exist is reachable.
