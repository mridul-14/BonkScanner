"""Every function-body import of a local module must actually resolve.

Written after step 21 shipped a crash on the **first line of the real app**
while all 663 tests, `test_import_direction`, pyflakes and a 12322-leaf
differential trace were green.

What happened
=============

Step 21a moved `_apply_summary_label_padding` from `gui_layout` into
`ui.shared` and had `gui_layout` import it back. Step 21d moved the Compare Runs
panel builders out of `gui_layout`, which left that re-import unused; pyflakes
said so, and it was deleted.

But `ui/tabs/player_stats/live_stats.py:496` imports that name from
`gui_layout` **inside `build()`** -- a deliberate deferral, because a
module-scope import there closes the
`gui_layout -> ui.tabs.player_stats -> live_stats -> gui_layout` cycle. Nothing
saw it:

* **pyflakes** analyses one file at a time; the deleted name was unused *in
  `gui_layout`*, which was true.
* **`test_import_direction`** parses ASTs and never imports, by design.
* **The suite** never builds the Live Stats tab -- 52 `object.__new__` doubles
  exist precisely to avoid paying for `MegabonkApp.__init__`.
* **The step-21 differential trace** builds the Recordings and Compare Runs
  tabs offscreen. Not this one. Its "0 differing leaves" was true and blind.

Every check was correct about its own subject and the app did not start.

Why this check, rather than "build the app in a test"
=====================================================

Constructing `MegabonkApp` starts a `QApplication`, ~166 widgets, an overlay
server, a hotkey manager and two timers. That belongs in the packaged-exe run,
not in a unit suite that would then own the flakiness.

A deferred import is a *dependency declared away from where it is checked*, and
the only reason it drifts silently is that nothing resolves it until the line
runs. So resolve them all, here, deterministically. This generalises to steps
22-26, every one of which moves names between these modules.

Third-party deferred imports (`win32cred`, `keyring`) are skipped: those are
guarded on purpose and their absence is a supported state.
