"""Step 28c commit 2: the run timer is read once per pass and shared by every
due on-tick consumer.

This is the file that decides stop condition 6 -- "the address-level run-timer
duplicate count does not fall after 28c commit 2". Before this slice three
independent code paths each issued their own physical read of
``0x2f62398+0x20`` on a tick where all three were due:

    app/refresh_tasks.py       the combat task            (RUN_TIMER source)
    app/player_stats_memory.py the 10 s full snapshot     (direct get_run_timer)
    app/player_stats_memory.py the recording lifecycle    (direct get_run_timer)

The count is asserted here dynamically rather than read off a hand-maintained
table in the census, because a static map cannot tell whether the collapse
actually happened -- it only records what someone believed.
