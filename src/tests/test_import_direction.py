"""Enforces the layer table from §2 of the refactor roadmap.

Five packages, imports point downward only. Review does not catch drift here --
the ``infra -> projections`` edge below sat unnoticed inside a method body
through a step that explicitly grepped for layering violations.

Three outcomes are kept apart on purpose:

* **Violation** -- a runtime edge the §2 table forbids, not in any allowlist.
  Fails.
* **Debt** -- a known bad edge, listed in ``KNOWN_VIOLATIONS`` or
  ``TOPLEVEL_DEBT`` with what will remove it. Does not fail while it matches
  reality; fails once the entry goes stale.
* **Type-checking edge** -- forbidden by the table but inside
  ``if TYPE_CHECKING:``, so it does not exist at runtime. Listed in
  ``TYPE_CHECKING_DEBT``, same staleness rule.

Every allowlist here shrinks and never grows: an entry that no longer
corresponds to a real import fails the suite, so paying a debt down forces the
record to be updated with it.

        survived a review that grepped for it. Step 17b paid that debt off, so
        the assertion is now made against the nested imports that remain --
        the TYPE_CHECKING-guarded ones, which are also not module-level
        statements and which step 16's mutation table already records as being
        lost when `ast.walk(tree)` is downgraded to `tree.body`.

        Retargeted rather than deleted: this is the property that made the
        checker find anything at all, and it must outlive the single edge that
        motivated it.
