"""Scrubbing the Live Stats timeline must survive the next refresh tick.

Reported from a live drive on 2026-07-19: while recording, dragging the
timeline to an earlier snapshot showed that snapshot's time, kills and items,
and roughly a second later the Run Summary and stage summary cards reverted to
the live run.

Cause, and it long predates the step-18 pilot that made the path easy to reach:
every live refresh tick ran `player_stats_selected_snapshot_index = None` and
repainted live values, with no guard for a selection the user had made by hand.
`app/player_stats_refresh.py` was byte-identical across the pilot's two commits.

These tests drive `refresh_live_player_stats_now` itself rather than the
predicate alone, because the predicate being correct proves nothing about the
two call sites that have to consult it -- the capture branch and the live
branch.
