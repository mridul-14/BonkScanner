"""The Key counter against a drained passive-item dictionary.

The passive inventory is reachable by two pointer routes, and **either can hand
back a live pointer to an emptied dictionary**. Measured live on 2026-08-03,
mid-run with 25 items held:

    owner_stats +0xA0 -> +0x50            count=0  version=0  entries=0x0
    owner_stats +0x28 -> +0x20 -> +0x10   count=25 version=25

`_resolve_preferred_passive_item_dict` used to return the first *non-null*
pointer, so it picked the corpse and never looked further. That is not a
theoretical failure: with the game in that state, `get_expected_chest_inputs`
reported `key_count=0` for a player visibly holding `Key x1`.

The Key is not special to any of this -- `_get_cached_key_count` resolves the
dictionary and then searches it by name, exactly as it would for any other
item. That is why these tests need no Key drop to be meaningful, and why the
fix is verified here rather than by waiting for one in a live run.

The drained state was reached by restarting a run **without restarting the
game**. A session that plays one run from a fresh launch never enters it, which
matches what the recordings show: `950k.jsonl` tracks `keys_count` correctly
from 1 to 7 across 670 snapshots holding a Key, and `970k.jsonl` predates the
field entirely. No recorded run carries the signature of this bug.
