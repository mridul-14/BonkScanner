"""Refresh-task wiring: the RefreshCoordinator registrations and demand
predicates that decide which fast-tick work actually runs.

Moved out of ``PlayerStatsMixin`` without behaviour change. These predicates
encode domain rules ("is a KPS consumer active") and only lived in a GUI file
because the timer that drives them does -- the GUI keeps thread ownership and
calls ``ensure_refresh_coordinator(self).tick()`` from
``update_player_stats_timer``, which step 14c moved on to
``app/player_stats_refresh.py``.

That driver is now the only one. Every cadence lives in a task's
``interval_ms``: a second 10 s timer used to run the recording lifecycle from
its own callback body, so collapsing the timers without giving that work a
task of its own would have run it 20x more often. Having its own task is what
later let step 8b move it to 1 s on its own merits, without dragging the 10 s
snapshot along.

``ensure_refresh_coordinator`` and ``overlay_widget_refresh_active`` are plain
functions, not mixin methods: each also has callers outside this module (the
timer driver, and the overlay predicate that is now ``overlay_requires_player_
snapshot`` below). A mixin method reachable only via the shared ``self`` would
show up as a new hidden cross-mixin read the moment its caller and its
definition live in different files -- passing the owner explicitly avoids that
without changing behaviour.

Step 20e moved **four more demand predicates in from
``app/player_stats_refresh.py``** for exactly that reason, and the long comment
above ``in_game_overlay_widget_enabled`` records the measurement: that module is
the top of the app import DAG, so each of those names was a read pointing
against the import arrow. They are the same shape as the pair above now.

The two ``record_player_stats_memory_*`` streak recorders and the reconnect
threshold used to live here for that same reason, but they moved to
``app/player_stats_memory.py`` (joining their game-data siblings) to delete the
``player_stats_memory -> refresh_tasks`` import edge, and that is the point: the
service conversion below needs ``refresh_tasks`` to import
``player_stats_memory``, and the old edge would have closed a cycle. Step 20f
then stopped calling the owner-taking ``record_player_stats_memory_*`` adapters
altogether -- the service holds the memory service directly, so it calls
``record_memory_success``/``record_memory_failure`` on it and the adapter import
is gone from this file.

Step 20f converted the rest -- the six ``_should_refresh_*``/``_refresh_*_task``
pairs and their private helpers -- from ``RefreshTasksMixin`` into the
``RefreshTasks`` service below, the sixth of the seven app-side MRO bases and
the last one that had no caller outside this module. Every dependency is an
injected zero-argument callable for the reason ``player_stats_memory.py``'s
header spells out: a mixin method resolves ``self`` late, on every call, and a
constructor argument resolves it once. Step 20 shipped that difference as a bug
twice, so nothing here is captured -- only re-resolved.

**The injected attribute names are deliberately distinct from the other two
services'.** ``PlayerStatsMemory`` and ``VodCapture`` both spell a live-stats-tab
predicate, and when the memory conversion reused ``VodCapture``'s
``_is_live_stats_tab_active`` the cluster scanner reported two services' private
callables as one piece of unowned state. ``_tab_active``/``_twitch_active``/
``_tracker`` and friends below are checked against both.

**What this service owns: one field, decided by counting.**
``_player_stats_refresh_status_text`` had every reader and writer inside this
file -- nothing in ``src/`` else touches it -- so it moved in, exactly as the
two reconnect streaks moved into ``PlayerStatsMemory``. It keeps its old
spelling and is initialised to the value the ``getattr`` default used to
supply, so the pre-first-write read is unchanged. (``_last_fast_kps_game_time_seconds``
moved in the same way and has since been deleted: the game-time KPS rework
keeps its second cursor next to the history it indexes, in ``_CombatState``.)
``_refresh_coordinator`` does **not** move: it stays behind
``ensure_refresh_coordinator`` because the coordinator owns it and a test reads
``app._refresh_coordinator.diagnostics()``.

**The seven ``getattr``/``callable`` demand guards are gone, and dropping them
changed nothing.** Each guarded site kept its ``try``/``except`` and the injected
callable raises ``AttributeError`` on an owner missing the predicate -- which
takes the same branch the ``callable()`` fallthrough took. The two direct,
unguarded call sites (``_should_refresh_expected_chest_inputs`` and
``_should_refresh_chaos_tome``) still propagate, exactly as before.
