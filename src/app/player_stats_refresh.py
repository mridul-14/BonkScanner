"""The player-stats refresh orchestration -- the fast-tick body and
``refresh_live_player_stats_now``, the seam that turns one memory read into a
tracker update and a UI render.

Split out of ``PlayerStatsMixin`` in step 14c, alongside
``app/player_stats_memory.py``; the two moved together because twelve
class-qualified ``_record_player_stats_game_data_memory_*`` call sites spanned
both, and a qualified call left pointing at a class its target has left is a
silent ``AttributeError`` (see the Chaos Tome regression fixed earlier in that
step). **Step 20 retired all twelve**: both recorders are module-level
functions now, so the two modules are no longer welded together by a call
spelling.

**Step 20e moved four demand predicates out of here** and into
``app/refresh_tasks.py``: ``_player_stats_refresh_required``,
``_overlay_requires_player_snapshot``,
``_in_game_overlay_requires_player_stats_refresh`` and the ``@staticmethod``
``_in_game_overlay_widget_enabled``. The first had **zero** callers in this
module and one there; the last had three here and six there and never read
``self`` at all. This module is the top of the app import DAG -- it imports
``refresh_tasks``, ``vod_capture`` and ``run_lifecycle``, and nothing in
``app/`` imports it -- so every one of those names was a read pointing against
the import arrow, and converting either mixin with them still here would have
had to close that loop through a module-level import.

**Step 20g converted ``PlayerStatsRefreshMixin`` into the ``PlayerStatsRefresh``
service below -- the seventh and last of the app-side MRO bases, taking
``MegabonkApp`` to nine and the app-layer hidden-dependency slice to zero.**
Every dependency is an injected zero-argument callable for the reason
``player_stats_memory.py``'s header spells out: a mixin method resolves ``self``
late, on every call, and a constructor argument resolves it once. Step 20
shipped that difference as a bug twice, so nothing here is captured -- only
re-resolved. ``self.live_run_tracker`` in particular was read eleven times in
one method body and ``MegabonkApp`` replaces the tracker per run.

**The two methods stay on ``MegabonkApp`` as thin delegators, and that is the
measurement, not a concession.** ``RefreshTasksMixin``'s six method pairs had
*zero* callers outside their own module, so the service absorbed them outright.
Both of this mixin's methods are the opposite: ``refresh_live_player_stats_now``
is called on the owner from ``gui_layout.py``, ``gui_twitch.py``,
``app/refresh_tasks.py`` and ``app/vod_capture.py``, and
``update_player_stats_timer`` is ``gui_app.py``'s ``tick=``. That is genuine
``MegabonkApp`` surface -- the same finding the ``player_stats_client``
properties got in ``da7fdc6`` -- so ``gui_app.py`` keeps two one-line methods
that resolve this service and forward. The two ``app/`` call sites already
receive the command as an ``owner``-resolved lambda and did not change: an
``import app.player_stats_refresh`` from inside ``app/`` would close the loop
20e and 20f spent two commits opening.

**Known debt, carried not deepened:** ``refresh_now`` still drives seven UI
operations. They are injected view ports now rather than reads off a shared
``self``, but the ordering between them is still this method's, which is the
same Qt leak step 6 carried into ``app/refresh_tasks.py``.

The four module-level ``record_player_stats_*`` adapters in
``app/player_stats_memory.py`` lost their last production caller here: the
service holds the memory service directly and calls
``record_memory_success``/``record_memory_failure`` on it, as ``RefreshTasks``
already did. They are **deliberately not deleted** -- ``tools/step20_memory_
trace.py`` drives the streak through that spelling against both trees and
``step20_player_stats_memory_smoke.py`` asserts on it, so removing them costs
the primary verification apparatus for no production gain. That deletion
belongs with the memory trace's retirement.

``ModuleNotFoundError`` is ``infra.memory.reader``'s, not the builtin. It
shadows it, and the ``except`` clauses depend on that.

    reported two services' private callables as one piece of unowned state.

    This service owns **no** state. Every field the old mixin touched has a

    app-owned (``gui_layout`` and the two Player Stats tabs read them), the two
    clients are the ``AppCoordinator``'s, and the reconnect streaks are
    ``PlayerStatsMemory``'s. There was nothing left to pull in, which is why
