"""Memory client for player stats.

The domain half lives in ``core.stats``. Step 2 re-exported those names here so
that ``from player_stats import ...`` call sites kept working across the split;
step 10 moved this client and rewrote every call site to import types from
``core.stats`` directly, so the ``__all__`` re-exports below now have **no
external consumers** -- only this module's own internal use of them is load
bearing. They are kept for one release as a courtesy to anything unmerged;
delete them once nothing depends on this module for types.

    ``class_name`` is the IL2CPP class from ``dump.cs``. It is not the lookup
    key -- it is the *check*. The key is the item enum id, because the two
    naming spaces do not agree: ``ITEM_ENUM_NAMES_BY_ID[85]`` is ``BobsLantern``
    while the class is ``ItemBobLantern``, and ``74`` is ``GloveBlood`` against
    ``ItemGlovesBlood``. Keying on a name built from the enum table would miss
    silently.

    The verification matters more than it looks. Field offsets are per class, so
    reading this pair off the wrong object does not fail -- it returns
    well-formed floats. A sweep of the live inventory for values that track the
    game clock found nine hits: one was this item, seven were sub-second proc
    timers (``ItemSpikyShield`` and ``ItemBeefyRing`` keep theirs at ``0x3C``,
    exactly where the lantern keeps ``cooldown``), one was a *last*-fired mark
    reading in the past, and one was not a declared field at all. Nothing about
    a wrong read announces itself, so the class name is confirmed before the
    floats are trusted.
