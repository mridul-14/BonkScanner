"""Chest and key tracking: pure functions over ``_ChestState``.

Split out of ``live_run_tracker.py`` in step 13.  Nothing here acquires a
lock; ``LiveRunTracker`` calls in while already holding its single ``RLock``.

The one run-state dependency is explicit: ``update_chests_and_keys`` needs
the latest ``LiveRunSnapshot`` to know which stage the counts belong to, so
the tracker passes it in rather than this module reaching back for it.
