"""The live run tracker: the shell that owns the state its package computes.

``live_run_tracker.py``, top-level, until step 27c. Step 13 split the
internals out into this package -- ``chaos``, ``chests``, ``combat``,
``items``, ``powerups``, ``snapshots`` -- and left the shell behind because
the roadmap believed the move would touch ~117 sites. It touches **nine**
module-level import statements: that number counted ``self.live_run_tracker``
attribute accesses, which a file move does not touch at all.

Inside ``core/tracker/`` rather than beside it as ``core/live_run_tracker.py``:
it already imports six modules from this package and nothing in the package
imports it back, so ``__init__`` (empty) -> ``live_run`` -> siblings is a
chain with no cycle. Merging it into ``core/tracker/__init__.py`` would have
made ``from core.tracker import chaos`` on line 19 a self-import -- legal, and
exactly the kind of thing that works until it does not.

Two of the nine sites had no debt entry and no plan built from the registry
would have found them: ``gui_overlay.py`` and ``tracked_item_rules.py`` are
themselves top-level, so the import-direction checker assigns their edges no
direction and never reported them.

# `POWERUPS_SNAPSHOT_TTL_SECONDS` (1.5) because the stage timer is this fact's
# true sibling: both are clocks read by a fast refresh task on the same driver
# cadence, and both must survive a missed tick without blanking the card. The
# driver is configurable down to 100 ms and up to 500 ms (config.py:784-793),
# so 2.0 s is four missed ticks of margin at the slowest configured interval --
# long enough that normal jitter never blanks the clock, short enough that a
# genuinely dead read stops the display rather than showing a frozen time as
# if it were live.
FAST_RUN_TIMER_TTL_SECONDS = 2.0

# The fast inventory's freshness bound. Wider than the run clock's because the
# passive-items task runs at 1 s rather than on the 500 ms driver cadence, and
# because the cost of a stale value here is different: a stale clock shows a
# wrong time, a stale inventory would credit items to a stage boundary they
# were not observed at. Three missed ticks of margin, after which the boundary
# falls back to carrying no inventory at all -- which is what it did before the
# fast lane existed, so expiry degrades to the previous behaviour rather than
# to a wrong one.

# Luck's freshness bound. Equal to the inventory's, and for the reason the run
# clock's is equal to the stage timer's: these two are read by the *same task*

# gain be projected against a Luck the pass that observed it did not carry.

FAST_SIZE_TTL_SECONDS = 3.0

# Item cooldowns' freshness bound. Same pass as the inventory and Luck, so the

#
# What this bound does *not* do is worth stating, because the obvious reading of
# "TTL" is wrong here: it retires a reading whose *pass failed*, and nothing
# else. On the death screen every read keeps succeeding against a frozen clock,
# so the reading stays perpetually fresh and perpetually wrong -- 256
# consecutive successful reads over 26 s of wall-clock, measured. Only
