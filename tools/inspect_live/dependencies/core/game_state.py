"""Game runtime domain: game mode/state, map stats and the memory-reader port.

Qt-free and I/O-free -- imports stdlib only.

``MemoryReader`` here is deliberately *not* the same protocol as
``core.stats.types.MemoryReader``: this one needs ``read_u8``, that one needs
``read_ascii_string``. Each client declares the narrow slice it actually uses;
``ProcessMemory`` satisfies both.
